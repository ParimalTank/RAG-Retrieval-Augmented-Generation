# Learning Of RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation  

## Why Use RAG?  
RAG enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by incorporating factual data from external sources. In essence, it bridges the gap in understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) work. LLMs operate as neural networks, often measured by the number of parameters they contain.  

### Key Benefits:  
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Retrieves real-time and factual data to improve responses.  
- **Access to External Resources:** Enables AI models to fetch up-to-date information from live sources.  
- **Overcomes LLM Limitations:** Since LLMs rely on pre-trained data and are not updated in real time, RAG ensures access to current information.  

### Example  
A great example of RAG in action is **Perplexity AI**, which combines both RAG and LLM to provide fact-checked, real-time responses.

## Features  
- **Dynamic Resource Switching (Hot Swap):**  
  - Allows switching data sources without shutting down the system.  
  - Enables seamless integration of multiple external resources (e.g., databases, APIs, documents, and websites).

## How RAG Works  
1. **Data Retrieval:** Collects data from various resources such as databases, documents, websites, and APIs.  
2. **Chunking & Vectorization:** Breaks data into chunks and converts it into vector/embedding representations.  
3. **Storage in Vector Database:** The processed vectorized data is stored for efficient retrieval.  
4. **User Query Processing:**  
   - The user's query is converted into vector format.  
   - The system compares the query vector with stored vectors in the database.  
   - The most relevant data chunks are retrieved to create an **augmented context**.  
5. **LLM Processing:**  
   - The retrieved vectorized data is fed into an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).  
   - The model generates an accurate response based on the augmented context.
